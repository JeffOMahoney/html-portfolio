<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings, my name is Jeff and I am nearing the completion of my Web Development programming. So far, I am loving it. If you’re reading this, then you are interested in my portfolio. This portfolio contains some of my coding creations, so welcome and I hope you enjoy the experience.</p>
<p>From the course, I hope to achieve attaining employment in this field. I will relish the opportunity to develop and hone my skills further over the coming months and years, and even decades as I believe learning is a life-long pursuit that never ends. So far, I am receiving immense joy from the work that I have performed and look forward to experiencing even more satisfaction from this area of creativity.</p> 
<p>So once again, welcome to my first portfolio. This portfolio will no doubt grow, as I will update it over time. So whatever stage you encounter this portfolio, I hope you enjoy it. Please, don’t hesitate to contact me. Until we meet again.</p>
